# Features

- Automatic PvP:  Forget the need to manually enable or disable PvP. DayNightPvP takes care of this automatically,
  activating exciting PvP during the night and safely deactivating it during the day.

- Difficulty Adjustment: To add an extra challenge to your server, the plugin automatically adjusts the game difficulty
  when day or night begins.

- Support for Multiple Worlds: DayNightPvP works seamlessly across different worlds, allowing specific settings for each
  one.

- Customizable Configuration: Personalize the sounds that play at the start and end of PvP, and set custom messages to
  notify players.

- PlaceholderAPI Support: Easily display whether PvP is enabled or disabled on the player's Scoreboard or TAB.

- GriefPrevention Compatibility: You can choose whether GriefPrevention-protected lands will be safe during the night or
  also subject to PvP.

- Vault Support: With Vault support, you can determine if players should lose money upon dying during PvP and if the
  killer will receive the reward.

- WorldGuard Support: Easily define whether a WorldGuard region should have PvP enabled even during the day.

- Custom Day/Night Duration: Adjust the length of day and night cycles to suit your preferences.
